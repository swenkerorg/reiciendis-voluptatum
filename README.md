## Welcome to Skiff!

Skiff empowers free and more effective communication through private, end-to-end encrypted email. All messages sent between Skiff Mail users are end-to-end encrypted. Additionally, Skiff never stores unencrypted access to messages sent or received from external mail providers. Skiff Calendar, Pages, and Drive are also end-to-end encrypted, including all event details, files, text, and titles. Read more [here](https://skiff.com/security-model).
